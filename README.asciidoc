FFcast
======

FFcast deals with rectangles on screens. Mostly, it selects rectangles. Like
most boring jobs, there are many ways to do it: free selection, selection by
window, screen number, numeric geometry, or by edge detection. Simple
arithmetic operations allow simple combinations and adjustments.

Now FFcast knows all about these rectangles, but what to do with them? Well,
like most useless things, there are many ways to use them: in practice,
screenshots and screencasts are obviously popular options; in general, the
geometry can be utilized by any application that understands X geometry,
including window managers, xorg-apps (xclock, xev),

FFcast provides several short commands for common tasks, just to please its
users, but hardly ever satisfies anyone. Like most unhelpful tools, it
encourages its users to roll their own cigarettes.

Anyway, here's wonder...ful
https://github.com/lolilolicon/FFcast/wiki/Demos[demos].

Requirements
------------

Bash 4.3+,
FFmpeg (`png` `rec`),
ImageMagick (`trim`),
xdpyinfo (`-x`),
xprop (`-f`),
https://github.com/lolilolicon/xrectsel.git[xrectsel] (`-s`),
xwininfo (`-w`).
